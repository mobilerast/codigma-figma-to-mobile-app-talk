# codigma-figma-to-mobile-app-talk

Slides and resources for a short talk on turning Figma designs into React Native mobile apps with **Codigma.io**.

## What is this?

This repo contains:

- The slide deck (PDF or PPT)
- Example links or code snippets (if needed later)
- Basic info on how Codigma.io works with Figma and React Native

## Talk summary

In this talk, we walk through a simple flow:

1. Design a screen in **Figma**
2. Send the selected layer or screen to **Codigma.io**
3. Let Codigma generate **React Native** code
4. Preview it in **Expo Snack** on iOS and Android
5. Download the project and continue building

The goal is to save time on front-end work and move faster from design to real mobile app.
